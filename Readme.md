## I developed an MLOps project focused on evaluating student performance using machine learning. The project involved conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and training machine learning models, along with implementing a data ingestion pipeline to streamline data processing. I built a prediction pipeline using a Flask web application to serve the modelâ€™s predictions. For version control, Git was used, and a CI/CD pipeline was established using GitHub Actions to automate model testing and deployment. The project was deployed on both AWS and Azure cloud platforms, ensuring scalability and reliability. By integrating automation, cloud deployment, and continuous monitoring, this project effectively adheres to MLOps best practices..
